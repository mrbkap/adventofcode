Solutions to http://adventofcode.com/

I wasn't able to get December 22 and I needed help on at least one more of
the days, but this turned out to be a pretty good way to learn Rust. Some of
the solutions have my input with them, some don't. Also, some of my
programs have been modified to solve the second part of the problem and give
wrong answers for the first problems.
